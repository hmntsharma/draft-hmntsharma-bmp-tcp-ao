          TCP-AO Protection for BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
                   draft-hmntsharma-bmp-tcp-ao-latest

Abstract

   This document outlines the utilization of the Transmission Control
   Protocol - Authentication Option (TCP-AO), as prescribed in RFC5925,
   for the authentication of Border Gateway Protocol Monitoring Protocol
   (BMP) sessions, as specified in RFC7854.  The intent is to heighten
   security within the underlying Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   transport layer, ensuring the authentication of BMP sessions
   established between routers and BMP stations.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), as specified in RFC7854,
   recommends employing Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) from RFC4303
   to mitigate security concerns related to the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) session between routers and the BMP station managing
   BGP route collection.  This document underscores the preference for
   the use of Transmission Control Protocol - Authentication Option
   (TCP-AO) as the authentication method of choice for TCP-based network
   protocols such as BGP and LDP.  A comprehensive discussion of TCP-AO
   is provided in RFC5925.

2.  TCP-AO Protection for BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) outlined in RFC7854 plays a crucial
   role in network management by allowing routers to share information
   about their BGP tables, helping operators monitor and troubleshoot
   their networks effectively.  However, the security considerations
   associated with BMP have become increasingly critical in light of
   evolving cyber threats.  This document proposes that these concerns
   be addressed by introducing a framework that utilizes the
   Transmission Control Protocol - Authentication Option (TCP-AO),
   specified in RFC5925, to safeguard BMP sessions.

   Extending this security measure to BMP helps mitigate risks
   associated with unauthorized access, tampering, and other potential
   security vulnerabilities.  By integrating TCP-AO into BMP
   implementations, network operators can establish a more resilient and
   trustworthy foundation for BGP monitoring activities.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security of the BMP session gets a boost with TCP-AO, seamlessly
   implemented over the existing TCP transport, ensuring heightened
   protection without any additional load.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   This document is a result of BMP integration into the network.  While
   TCP-AO safeguards other TCP protocols, BMP lacks the same level of
   protection within this context.
